## Description

Welcome to my recreation of Pokemon UNITE!
This project aims to recreate the MOBA game Pokemon UNITE from scratch, using the Unity game engine.
This game uses the Netcode for gameobject package to provide a fully working multiplayer experience, and with the use of Unity Relays there's no need to handle ip addresses or port forwarding.

**Of course the original game is owned by Timi studios, this project was purely made for educational purposes and does not intend to replace in any way the original**

## Why This Project?

The idea to make this sparked when the original developers of Pok√©mon UNITE started doing some not so great decisions with their game, and so i decided to recreate it both as a joke and as a challenge for myself
By recreating a simplified version of Pokemon UNITE, I aimed to:

- **Learn and Apply Unity Skills**: Gain hands-on experience with Unity's multiplayer features, animation, and game mechanics.
- **Understand Game Design Principles**: Explore the strategic elements and balance considerations involved in designing a MOBA game.

## Installation
