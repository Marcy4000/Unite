  description: Flygon leaps into the air and crashes down, causing the ground to
    shake 3 times. Each wave damages opponents and slows them by 20% for 0.5s and
    adds an earthquake stack to them. Once 3 stacks are reached the enemy is stunned
    for 1.2s and has a 25% slow applied for 2s after the stun. Waves are 0.6s apart
    from each others, each wave doing more damage than the last
