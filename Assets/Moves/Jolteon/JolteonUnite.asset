  description: Jolteon becomes cloaked in electricity and dashes rapidly across the
    battlefield, damaging and paralyzing all enemies in its path. During this time,
    Jolteon is unstoppable and can freely pass through obstacles. The move lasts
    3 seconds, and Jolteon can control the initial direction of the dash, during
    the move it will bounce around like rollout, but it can be slightly adjusted
    with the right stick. The volt absorb bar then remains full for the next 5 seconds
    after the move ends
