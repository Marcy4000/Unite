  description: Fire a star-shaped projectile in a designated direction, dealing physical
    damage to enemies in its path. If the star travels its maximum range or hits
    an enemy, it splits into three smaller stars that spread outward. Each smaller
    star deals less damage than the original one. Stars bounce off walls when colliding.
