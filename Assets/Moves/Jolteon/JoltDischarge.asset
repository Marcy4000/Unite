  description: "Jolteon gains a speed boost and starts running in a chosen direction
    surrounded by an electric field, enemies in the field take tick based damage,
    and enemies hit by jolteon get knocked up. If a target is hit the move can be
    used again, this time with a shorter discharge radius and a faster movement speed,
    and all enemies caught get slowed for 1s (enemies directly hit get stunned again)\r\nWhen
    boosted by volt absorb the travel distance increases\r"
