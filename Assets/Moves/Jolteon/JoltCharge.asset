  description: Upon activation the user charges up gaining a temporary 25% increase
    to Attack an 30% for Defense, Sp. Defense, and Speed for 5s. If empowered by
    the passive, these buffs are enhanced to 35% to Attack and speed and 40% for
    Defense and Sp. Defense with a longer duration of 6s. An indicator appears to
    mark the charge, and the user is unable to move for 1s while performing the move.
    The passive charge is reduced by a small amount if the enhanced version is used.
