  description: 'Meowstic starts flying in the air and channels its psychic power
    to create a large protective field around itself (5.5m radius) for 6 seconds.
    Within this field, all allies receive a shield equal to 25% of their max HP,
    have their movement speed increased by 20%, and gain 10% cooldown reduction.
    Enemies within the field have their movement speed reduced by 25% and take periodic
    psychic damage every second.

    Meowstic is unstoppable during this move'
