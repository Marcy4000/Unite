  description: Glaceon gains an increase in movement speed by 40% for 1s while basic
    attack speed is increased by 60% for 2.5s. Basic attacks change into attacks
    that hurl chunks of ice for 2.5s. These chunks of ice deal damage to enemies
    they hit and decrease their movement speed by 30% for 1s. Each time a chunk of
    ice hits, Glaceon gains 2 ice crystals. If this move is used while launching
    crystals with Icicle Spear, or if this move is used after Icy Wind but before
    launching all crystals with the next auto attack, gain 2 ice crystals and increase
    Glaceon's movement speed by 50% for 0.5s.
