  description: Glaceon launches all of its stored ice crystals in rapid succession
    in the designated direction. If Glaceon has no ice crystals when this move is
    used, 2 ice crystals are instantly created and are launched. Launched ice crystals
    can hit enemies on the opposing team that are not the designated target of this
    move. The crystals will damage all enemies in the area of effect.  When this
    move is used, Ice Shard's cooldown is reduced by 2s and Freeze Dry's cooldown
    is reduced by 2.5s. A maximum of 12 ice crystals may be launched.
