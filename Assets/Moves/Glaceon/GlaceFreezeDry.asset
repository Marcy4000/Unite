  description: Shoot out a freezing burst of air in a forward direction. This burst
    explodes upon hitting an enemy or after traveling a set distance; dealing damage
    to all enemies in the area. Upon hitting an enemy, increase Glaceon's Sp. Atk
    by 50% for 3s. For each enemy hit by the explosion, Glaceon gains 2 ice crystals.
    The explosion also leaves behind an ice zone which slows enemies that enter by
    30% for 3s. If they remain in the ice zone for 2.5s, they become frozen for 0.6s.
