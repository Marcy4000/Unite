  description: Jump a short distance in the designated direction; Glaceon's next
    auto attack within 5s gains increased range and launches all stored ice crystals
    at an enemy, dealing damage to them. Glaceon then regains the same number of
    ice crystals that were launched. If an enemy is hit by 4 or more ice crystals,
    their movement speed is decreased by 8% per shard (stacking up to 6 times) for
    1s. If Glaceon has no ice crystals when this move is used, gain 2 ice crystals.
