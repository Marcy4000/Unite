  description: Create a protective ring around yourself or a nearby ally within range,
    granting a shield equal to 20% of their max HP and boosting their Attack and
    Sp. Attack by 45% for 4.5s. While active, the ring periodically heals the target
    every 0.7s for 6s. If the shield is broken, the ring ends prematurely. If no
    ally is within range, the move targets yourself instead.
