    "message": "Latest version: 0.3.3\n\nA pretty big rework for wild pokemons\n\n- Added a simple AI to wild pokemons:\u000BThey will walk towards whoever attacked them and start basic attacking when close enough\u000B- Added big jump pads to all maps\u000B- Added a menu to find and join open lobbies\n- Added a simple chat in the party screen\n- Fixed bugs\n\u000BOn certain platforms the player clothes may take more time to load.\n\nThank you for downloading this game,\u000Bwelcome to the my unite recreation!\u000B\u000BAs this is an early build bugs are expected and 100% going to happen, if you find any please report them in my discord server (link in the itch page)\u000B\u000BCurrently not every feature from the original is implemented, here's a list of features that are missing and planned to be added:\n- Jump Pads\n- Wild pokemon AI\n- Some moves on certain pokemons\u000B- More settings options\n- Other things i may have missed\u000B\u000BBut why should you play this? Idk at least you can't get slowbro united here. Jokes aside this is mainly so my concepts can actually be played.\u000B\u000BIf quick join isn't finding any match it's likely that there are no open rooms at the moment, in that case i suggest you create an open room yourself.\u000B\u000BLastly i hope you enjoy the experience and have some fun!\u000B\u000BMade with passion by JustMarcy\u000B(<b>Of course the original game is owned by Timi studios, this project was purely made for educational purposes and does not intend to replace in any way the original</b>)",
