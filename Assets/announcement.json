    "message": "Latest version: 0.1.11\n\n<b>Due to cost related issues i had to remove in game downloads of content, as a side effect the size of the game increased by a lot and the WebGL build had to be dropped until further notice, i am really sorry for this</b>\n\nLil small update, I'm busy with school so i don't have much time to code actual licenses\n\n- Added draft mode for Theia Sky Ruins and Mer Stadium\u000B- Slightly improved collisions when clipping inside walls\u000B- Added the ability to return to the main menu without leaving the lobby\n- Minor fixes\u000B\u000BOn certain platforms the player clothes may take more time to download, if you don't see your avatar it's probably still downloading\n\nThank you for downloading this game,\u000Bwelcome to the my unite recreation!\u000B\u000BAs this is an early build bugs are expected and 100% going to happen, if you find any please report them in my discord server (link in the itch page)\u000B\u000BCurrently not every feature from the original is implemented, here's a list of features that are missing and planned to be added:\n- Jump Pads\n- Wild pokemon AI\n- Some moves on certain pokemons\u000B- More settings options\n- Keyboard controls\u000B- Other things i may have missed\u000B\u000BBut why should you play this? Idk at least you can't get slowbro united here. Jokes aside this is mainly so my concepts can actually be played.\u000B\u000BIf quick join isn't finding any match it's likely that there are no open rooms at the moment, in that case i suggest you create an open room yourself.\u000B\u000BLastly i hope you enjoy the experience and have some fun!\u000B\u000BMade with passion by JustMarcy\u000B(<b>Of course the original game is owned by Timi studios, this project was purely made for educational purposes and does not intend to replace in any way the original</b>)",
