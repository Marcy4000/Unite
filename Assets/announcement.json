    "message": "Latest version: 0.1.2\n\nI've now released a WebGL build so you can play the game directly in your browser!\u000BIt's a bit unstable tho, and doesn't support features such as automatically detecting your region so i still suggest using the standalone version.\nAlso goal zones give vision now\n\nThank you for downloading this game,\u000Bwelcome to the first release of my unite recreation!\u000B\u000BAs this is the first build i release bugs are expected and 100% going to happen, if you find any please report them in my discord server (link in the itch page)\u000B\u000BCurrently not every feature from the original is implemented, here's a list of features that are missing and planned to be added:\n- Jump Pads\n- Rotom\u000B- Quick chat\n- Wild pokemon AI\n- Some moves on certain pokemons\u000B- More settings options\n- Keyboard controls\u000B- Other things i may have missed\u000B\u000BBut why should you play this? Idk at least you can't get slowbro united here. Jokes aside this is mainly so my concepts can actually be played.\u000B\u000BIf quick join isn't finding any match it's likely that there are no open rooms at the moment, in that case i suggest you create an open room yourself.\u000B\u000BLastly i hope you enjoy the experience and have some fun!\u000B\u000BMade with passion by JustMarcy\u000B(<b>Of course the original game is owned by Timi studios, this project was purely made for educational purposes and does not intend to replace in any way the original</b>)",
