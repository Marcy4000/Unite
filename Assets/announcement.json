Idk at least you can't get slowbro united here. Jokes aside this is mainly so my concepts can actually be played.\u000B\u000BIf quick join isn't finding any match it's likely that there are no open rooms at the moment, in that case i suggest you create an open room yourself.\u000B\u000BLastly i hope you enjoy the experience and have some fun!\u000B\u000BMade with passion by JustMarcy\u000B(<b>Of course the original game is owned by Timi studios, this project was purely made for educational purposes and does not intend to replace in any way the original</b>)",
